# AI Slop Patterns

Detection catalog for AI-generated code that passes lint and tests but reads as machine-written. Load when the user asks to deslop, clean up AI code, remove slop, or when reviewing AI-assisted changes.

Focus on distinctively AI-generated patterns, not general code quality (that belongs in `structural-quality-rubric.md`).

## Over-commenting

Comments that restate what the code already says.

**Flag:**
- JSDoc on functions with self-documenting names and types
- `// Handle the error` above a `catch` block
- `// Return the result` above a `return` statement
- `// Initialize variables` above `const` declarations
- Block comments explaining a single obvious line
- `// Destructure the props` above destructuring assignments

**Fix:** Delete it. If removal would confuse a reader, the code needs a better name, not a comment.

## Stale comments

Comments describing code the diff has since changed. Distinct from over-commenting: the problem is not that the comment is redundant, it is that it is now false, and the next reader trusts it over the code.

**Flag:**
- A comment naming a value, unit, limit, or branch the diff just changed
- A doc block whose `@param`, `@returns`, or thrown-error list no longer matches the signature
- A comment describing the approach that was intended rather than the one that shipped
- A "why" comment justifying a constraint the diff removed

**Fix:** Correct the comment, or delete it where the code now says the same thing. Quote both the comment and the line that refutes it; a stale-comment finding citing only the comment cannot be checked. Only comments this diff falsified are in scope; a repo-wide hunt produces noise rather than findings.

## History-citing comments

Comments that justify code by pointing at where the justification supposedly lives, rather than stating it. Distinct from stale comments: the problem is not that the comment has gone false, it is that the reason was never actually written down, only a pointer to a conversation the reader cannot reopen.

**Flag:**
- `// per review` / `// per PR feedback` / `// as discussed`
- `// changed after PR #<n>` or a bare issue/PR link standing in for the reason
- `// used to do X` / `// previously this was Y` with no statement of why the change happened
- `// workaround because <reviewer> said` / `// <name> wanted it this way`
- A commit hash or ticket id cited as the explanation instead of the invariant or bug class it fixed

**Fix:** Delete the comment, or replace it with the actual reason in the code's own terms: the invariant it protects, the bug class it prevents, the constraint it satisfies. That version survives the PR being squashed, the branch being deleted, and the reviewer leaving; a name or a PR number does not. If the history itself is the only thing worth keeping (why an odd-looking line is deliberate), put it in the commit message, where `git log` and `git blame` preserve it, not in a comment nobody will go re-fetch it from.

## Invented API

A call that reads as real and is not: a method, option, or import that exists in a similar library, an older or newer major version, or nowhere. The tell is fluency; the name is exactly what the API should have been called. It survives lint, survives type-check in JavaScript or behind `any`, and fails at the first runtime call, or worse, is an option the library silently ignores.

**Flag:**
- An import from a package whose installed version (per the lockfile) does not export that name
- A method on a library object that the package's `.d.ts` or docs do not list
- An option key in a config object the library never reads (no error, no effect)
- A CLI flag or environment variable the tool does not recognise
- A test that mocks the invented method, so the suite passes without ever calling the real library

**Fix:** Name the real API from `node_modules/<pkg>` at the installed version, or the closest one and what differs. Cite the export list or docs you checked; a "this does not exist" finding without the source you searched is itself unverifiable. A symbol absent from the installed package's `.d.ts` is confirmed, not plausible: the types are the export list. A symbol TypeScript accepts does exist, so look instead at the calls the checker never saw: JavaScript files, `any`-typed values, and string-keyed option bags.

## Unnecessary error handling

Wrapping infallible operations in try-catch or guarding impossible states.

**Flag:**
- try-catch around pure computations (string manipulation, array mapping, object destructuring)
- Null checks on values the type system guarantees are non-null
- `|| []` on a value already typed as an array
- `?? undefined` (a no-op: `undefined` is already the default)
- `|| ''` on a `string` (not `string | undefined`) type
- Catch blocks that just rethrow without modification
- Error boundaries wrapping components that cannot throw

**Fix:** Remove the guard only after proving the value is internal or already validated. Keep validation at system boundaries (user input, external APIs, network responses, generated files, persisted data).

## Type bypasses

Casting or suppressing types instead of fixing the underlying issue.

**Flag:**
- `as any`: always a smell; fix the type or narrow with a type guard
- `as unknown as T`: double-cast to force an incompatible type
- `@ts-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error` without an explanation comment
- Unnecessary type assertions on values that already match the target type
- `!` (non-null assertion) when the value could genuinely be null
- Generics defaulting to `any` (`useState<any>()`)

**Fix:** Fix the type at its source: fix a wrong upstream type upstream, or override a wrong third-party type with a targeted `.d.ts`.

## Premature abstraction

Abstractions created before a shared invariant, owner, lifecycle, or failure mode justifies them.

**Flag:**
- Helper functions called from exactly one site that name no domain concept, boundary, or repeated invariant
- Wrapper classes with a single method that delegates to the wrapped object
- Config objects consumed by one function
- Factory functions that always return the same variant
- Custom hooks that thinly wrap a single `useState` or `useEffect`
- `utils/` files with one export
- Constants extracted for a value used once

**Fix:** Inline the abstraction unless it protects shared knowledge: an invariant, protocol, lifecycle, owner, or business rule. Do not extract coincidental shape.

## Scaffolding without a consumer

Support structure built out in full while the thing it supports is absent or unreachable. Distinct from premature abstraction: the abstraction at least has a caller. Distinct from test padding: that covers tests for code that exists but assert nothing actionable. If the module under test does not exist, report it here only, once.

**Flag:**
- Test files for a module, route, or export that does not exist, or that nothing reaches
- A generated registry, schema, or type surface no source file imports
- A CI job or check enforcing a contract nothing currently emits
- Fixtures, mocks, or seed data for an unbuilt API
- Docs or a README section describing a command the binary does not implement

**Fix:** Delete the artifact, or build its consumer in the same diff. Shipped alone it is complete, it passes review, and it delivers nothing while implying the work is done. A search returning nothing is not proof of no consumer: dynamic imports, framework file-name conventions, generated code, and other repos all reach code no static search finds.

## Verbose naming

Names repeating info already in the type system or context.

**Flag:**
- `userArray`, `nameString`, `isLoadingBoolean` (type is in the name)
- `handleOnClickButton` (redundant event + element in handler name)
- `fetchDataFromAPIAndTransformResponse` (implementation in the name)
- `getUserByIdFromDatabase` (storage detail in the name)
- `IUserInterface`, `UserType` (type-system prefix/suffix on types)
- `setIsLoadingToTrue` (value in the setter name)

**Fix:** Use the simplest name that is unambiguous in context: `users`, `name`, `loading`, `handleClick`, `fetchUser`, `getUser`.

## Structural bloat

Files, exports, and patterns that add surface area without value.

**Flag:**
- Barrel files (`index.ts`) that re-export everything from a directory
- Empty utility files with boilerplate but no logic
- Files with only type re-exports (`export type { Foo } from './foo'`)
- Dead code behind `if (false)` or `// @deprecated` with no removal date
- Old/new dual paths, legacy aliases, or re-exports kept "for compatibility" when nothing depends on the old path
- Duplicate type definitions when a shared type exists
- Separate files for a single small constant or type

**Fix:** Delete the file or inline it. Co-locate small types and constants with their consumer.

## Defensive excess

Guarding against states the language or framework prevents.

**Flag:**
- `?.` optional chaining on values that cannot be null (non-optional props, required function parameters, `const` assignments from non-nullable sources)
- `Array.isArray()` check on a value typed as `T[]`
- `typeof x === 'function'` on a value typed as a function
- `if (x !== null && x !== undefined)` when the type is not nullable
- `try { JSON.parse(knownValidJSON) }` on a value that is always valid JSON
- Fallback UI for error states that cannot occur in the component's data flow

**Fix:** Remove the guard only after proving the value is internal or already validated. If unsure, fix the type or boundary validation instead of adding local defensive noise.

## Template residue

Placeholder content left behind from AI generation.

**Flag:**
- `// TODO: implement` or `// TODO: Add error handling` with no implementation
- `// Add your logic here`
- Generic error messages: `"An error occurred"`, `"Something went wrong"`, `"Failed to process request"`
- Debugging console.log statements: `console.log('here')`, `console.log(data)`
- Commented-out code blocks with no explanation
- Empty function bodies or stub returns (`return null`, `return undefined`, `return {}`)

**Fix:** Implement the functionality or delete the placeholder. Replace generic error messages with specific, actionable ones.

## Test padding

Tests generated because coverage looks like rigor. The tell: the test cannot fail for a reason anyone would act on. `test-gate.md` owns the per-test questions (pins changed behavior, can fail, duplicate, snapshot or implementation detail, mock-only) and the delete-or-rewrite rule; flag these slop shapes on top of it:

**Flag:**
- Render-only tests: presence assertions with no interaction or branch
- Framework re-tests: proving React renders, the router routes, or the ORM saves
- Diff-mirror tests: the assertion repeats a literal copied from the diff (a config row, flag default, route entry, label, or copy string); a second ledger to maintain, not behavior coverage
- Export-for-testability: a helper extracted or exported solely so a test can name it, proving nothing about the original behavior
- Fake integration tests: hand-rolled in-memory emulators of behavior that lives in the real system (schema, validators, indexes, permissions), unable to catch the bug class they claim to cover

**Fix:** Delete the test. A bug fix keeps exactly one: a repro that fails on the pre-fix code, anchored at the seam that failed (route, API, browser flow, integration point). A config-adjacent test stays only if it proves a rule across a class of cases; if its name contains one item id and its assertion repeats the value just changed, it goes.

## Applying fixes

When reviewing for slop:

1. Read the diff with slop detection in mind; don't flag pre-existing patterns outside the diff
2. Group findings by category, not by file
3. Prioritize behavioral preservation: deslop changes should never alter runtime behavior
4. Apply the codebase's existing conventions, not an ideal standard
5. Use git blame only to separate pre-existing code from diff scope; judge slop from code patterns, not author or timing
