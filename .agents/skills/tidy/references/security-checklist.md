# Security Checklist

Three-tier classification for security-relevant changes. Load when the diff touches auth, input handling, external APIs, file uploads, or environment config, and always in tidy's Security audit mode (whole-codebase).

## How to use this file

- **Diff review (default):** classify the security-relevant lines with Always do / Ask first / Never do / OWASP quick reference.
- **Security audit mode (whole-codebase):** also run the Threat-model lens and Vulnerability-class sweep across the named subsystem or repo. Walk by class, confirm each hit against real code, report only concrete exploit paths.

## Always Do

For every change handling user input, authentication, or external data, check what the OWASP table and the class sweep below do not name:

- **Validate input at system boundaries:** schema validation (Zod, Yup) server-side; reject unexpected shapes early
- **Set security headers:** `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- **Secure cookies:** `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` (or `Lax` with justification)

Parameterized queries, output encoding, TLS, password hashing (bcrypt, scrypt, or argon2), and dependency audits are checked through those two tables.

## Ask First

Flag for human confirmation before merging; verify intent and scope:

- **Auth flow changes:** login, logout, session management, token refresh, OAuth callback
- **Sensitive data storage:** PII, payment info, health data, credentials; verify encryption at rest
- **External service integrations:** new API keys, webhook endpoints, third-party SDKs
- **CORS config changes:** verify allowed origins are intentional and minimal
- **File upload handling:** validate type, size limits, storage location; never serve uploads from the app domain without scanning
- **Rate limiting changes:** verify thresholds curb abuse without blocking legitimate users
- **Permission or role changes:** elevation, new roles, access control modifications
- **Environment variable additions:** no hardcoded secrets; in `.env.example` but not committed in `.env`

## Never Do

Automatic `critical` severity if found in the diff:

- **Commit secrets:** API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys in source
- **Log sensitive data:** PII, tokens, passwords, or full request bodies in production logs
- **Client-side-only validation:** always validate server-side; client validation is UX, not security
- **Disable security headers:** removing CSP, HSTS, or X-Frame-Options without documented justification
- **Use `eval()` or `innerHTML` with user data:** use safe alternatives (`JSON.parse`, `textContent`, sanitized HTML)
- **Store auth tokens in `localStorage`:** use `HttpOnly` cookies; `localStorage` is accessible to any XSS
- **Expose stack traces in production:** generic error messages; log details server-side only
- **Trust client-sent IDs for authorization:** always verify ownership server-side

## OWASP Quick Reference

Diff-mode shortcut: the highest-yield categories to eyeball on a changed line, named per OWASP Top 10:2025. In audit mode skip this and run the fuller Vulnerability-class sweep below (a superset).

| OWASP 2025 category | What to look for in the diff |
|---|---|
| A01 Broken Access Control | Missing ownership checks, direct object references without auth, a role check on the client only |
| A02 Security Misconfiguration | Debug mode in production, default credentials, permissive CORS, a security header removed |
| A03 Software Supply Chain Failures | A changed dependency that `npm audit` (or equivalent) flags as known-vulnerable, a new dependency for a one-liner, unpinned or `latest` version, a package with a `postinstall` script, lockfile churn the diff does not explain, a CI workflow granting write permissions |
| A04 Cryptographic Failures | Unencrypted PII, `Math.random` for tokens, MD5 or SHA for passwords, missing TLS |
| A05 Injection | String concatenation with user input in queries or shell commands; XSS via unescaped content, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `innerHTML` |
| A07 Authentication Failures | Weak session config, missing token rotation, insecure password storage, `===` on secrets instead of a constant-time compare |
| A08 Software or Data Integrity Failures | Webhook or callback accepted without signature verification over the raw bytes; deserializing untrusted input |
| A09 Security Logging and Alerting Failures | A sensitive mutation (funds, permissions, config) with no record of who changed what; secrets or PII written to logs |
| A10 Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions | A `catch` on an auth, authz, or validation path that falls through to the allow branch (fail-open); a default value standing in for a failed permission lookup |

Low-yield classes that cost the reader more than they return unless the exploit path is concrete: a race you cannot name the interleaving for, ReDoS on input an attacker cannot control, resource exhaustion with no amplification, an outdated library whose vulnerable function the code never calls, and log spoofing. Anthropic's open-source `/security-review` prompt excludes the same set for the same reason. Report them only as `plausible` with the missing piece named, or drop them.

## Threat-model lens (audit mode)

Frame what you're protecting before sweeping, so the sweep is targeted, not generic:

- **Assets:** what's worth stealing or breaking? Credentials, PII, payment data, tenant isolation, admin capability.
- **Entry points:** where untrusted input enters: HTTP routes, webhooks, file uploads, message queues, CLI args, env, third-party callbacks.
- **Trust boundaries:** where does data cross from less-trusted to more-trusted (client to server, tenant to tenant, user to admin, external API to internal)? Check authz and validation at each.
- **Actors:** anonymous, authenticated, other tenant, insider, compromised dependency. Per finding ask "which actor reaches this, and what do they gain?"

A finding matters only if a real actor reaches a real asset through a real entry point. Drop speculative items.

## Vulnerability-class sweep (audit mode)

Walk the codebase one class at a time: search for the pattern, then confirm each hit against the actual code before reporting. Search anchors are starting points, not exhaustive.

| Class | Search anchors | Confirm |
|---|---|---|
| Injection (SQL/NoSQL/OS/LDAP) | string-built queries, template literals in queries, `exec`/`spawn`/`child_process`, `$where` | user input reaches the sink unparameterized |
| Broken access control | route handlers, `findById` without owner check, role checks, IDOR on path/body IDs | authorization enforced server-side per request, ownership verified |
| Authentication & session | token issue/verify, password hashing, session config, refresh/rotation | strong hashing, expiry, rotation, no fixation, no auth bypass path |
| Secrets & config | `process.env`, hardcoded keys/tokens, committed `.env`, logging of secrets | no secrets in source/logs; secrets sourced from env/secret manager |
| Deserialization & parsing | `JSON.parse` on untrusted data into eval paths, `yaml.load`, `eval`, `Function()`, prototype pollution sinks | untrusted input can't reach code execution or pollute prototypes |
| SSRF & outbound requests | `fetch`/`axios`/`http` with user-controlled URLs, webhook callbacks | destination validated/allow-listed; no internal-network reach |
| File handling | upload handlers, path joins with user input, `fs` reads/writes from request data | path traversal blocked, type/size validated, stored outside web root |
| XSS & output encoding | `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `innerHTML`, unescaped templating, `res.send` of user data | output escaped/sanitized at render |
| Crypto | custom crypto, `Math.random` for tokens, weak/legacy algorithms, ECB mode | vetted primitives, CSPRNG for tokens, modern algorithms |
| Dependencies & supply chain | `package.json`/lockfile, postinstall scripts, unpinned versions | no known-vulnerable or unexpected packages; `npm audit` clean of highs |
| Error handling & info leak | stack traces to client, verbose errors, debug flags | generic client errors; details logged server-side only |
| Rate limiting & DoS | unbounded loops over user input, missing limits on expensive endpoints | abuse-prone endpoints bounded/limited |

For each confirmed hit, report through the standard three-tier output with the vulnerability class, location, and exploit path.
